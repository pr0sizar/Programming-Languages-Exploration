# Programming Language Exploration

This project investigates programming language data using LINQ queries in C#. The information is saved in a.tsv file format and includes the year of invention, name of the language, primary developer, and predecessors. The project's main purpose is to extract meaningful information about programming languages from this data by running different queries and analysis.

## Tasks

- **Explore the Data**: The project starts by printing all of the languages stored in the dataset, then moves on to do different queries and analysis.

- **Microsoft Languages**: Queries are run to identify and print information on Microsoft-developed languages.

- **Good Programmers Copy...**: Languages descended from Lisp are listed and printed.

- **Y2K**: The total number of languages and languages introduced between 1995 and 2005 is counted and published.

- **Print Methods**: Methods have been developed to effectively print language information and query results.

## Usage

1. Transfer the repository to your own PC.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio or your choice C# IDE.
3. Launch the 'Program.cs' file to run the LINQ queries and investigate the programming language data.

## Dependencies.

.NET Core SDK
